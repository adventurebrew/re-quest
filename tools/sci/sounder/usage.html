<h3>Welcome</h3>
<b>Sounder</b> can do more or less anything that you'd like with Sierra's SCI sound format.
If you find anything that you'd like to do, but cannot, or any other problem, please contact me
<i>(Menu/File/Report an issue, or suggest a feature)</i>

<h3>Keep In Touch</h3>
<i>Sounder</i> is still young, and probably has some bugs and problems. Please, update me with any problem or issue. I'd
also like to hear if you're just using it, and you're satisfied :-)
<p></p>
I can be reached in:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/adventurebrew/re-quest/issues">https://github.com/adventurebrew/re-quest/issues</a>
        (you can open an "issue" even for a non bug)
    </li>
    <li>ZvikaZ at <a href="https://sciprogramming.com">https://sciprogramming.com/</a> forums (or PM)</li>
    <li>ZvikaZ at ScummVM's Discord server</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>
You should select an <b>input file</b> to work on (multiple files can be selected, either with <code>*</code>, or with
the dialog).
<p>
    Usually, you'll want to leave the <b>input version</b> as <code>AUTO_DETECT</code>, unless there are problems.
<p>
    Now, you can choose to do various things with the file (you can select any combination, by default nothing is done):
<ul>
    <li><b>Play</b> file's musical contents (ignoring digital sample)</li>
    <li><b>Save</b> file's contents in various formats</li>
    <li>Add <b>digital sample</b> (or replace it, if it already exists)</li>
    <li>Play <b>digital sample</b></li>
    <li>Save only the <b>digital sample</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
    When you've selected the required actions, click <b>Start</b>.

<p> Now, you can either <b>Restart</b> to repeat the exact same actions, <b>Edit</b> to go back and modify
    some settings, or <b>Close</b> to finish.

<h3>Input</h3>
The input file can be one of:
<ul>
    <li>Early SCI0 (rare)</li>
    <li>SCI0</li>
    <li>SCI1+</li>
    <li>Standard MIDI File</li>
</ul>

It's recommended to use <code>AUTO_DETECT</code>. If something is weird, try and set it explicitly, it might improve the
error
message.

<h3>Play</h3>
After a file has been selected, and <b>play</b> has been checked, it's possible to select the <b>play device</b> - each
device (Adlib/MT-32/etc.) has
channels associated with it, this selects which channels to play (or <b>all channels in file</b>). It doesn't try
to emulate that sound device, it merely selects the sound device's relevant channels. <br>
Note: if there's a problem in reading the file, 'play device' will show every device known to Sounder.

<p>
    By default the music will be played through <i>Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth</i> (on Windows). Sadly, this device
    isn't perfect.
    You might want to install FluidSynth, or similar program, to add more ports. Furthermore, it's recommended to
    install <i>munt</i>
    in order to have an MT-32 emulation, if you want to hear its channels.

<p>The <b>port</b> can be changed to any MIDI port recognized by your OS.</p>

<h3>Save</h3>
The file can be saved in any of the following formats, regardless of its original format:
<ul>
    <li>Early SCI0 (rare)</li>
    <li>SCI0</li>
    <li>SCI1+</li>
    <li>Standard MIDI File</li>
</ul>

<p>If not save format is chosen, no file will be saved.</p>

<p>After selecting save format, the other save-related options can be chosen.</p>
<p>
    If the input file had a digital sample, or a digital sample was loaded (in <b>input wav</b>), and the file isn't
    saved as <i>Standard MIDI File</i> - then the digital sample will be saved as part of the file.
<p>You can supply a name (and path) for the <b>save file</b>, or leave that field empty, and use the default - which is
    adding <i>.snd</i> for any Sierra format, and <i>.mid</i> for MIDI files - even if that extension already existed.
    e.g., if the original file is <code>100.snd</code> it will be saved as <code>100.snd.snd</code></p>
<p>If such file exists, it will be overwritten without further notice!</p>

<p>Similarly to the <b>play device</b> option, you can control the <b>save midi device</b>. Those settings aren't
    related to each other.</p>


<h3>Digital</h3>
Digital sample can come from two places:
<ul>
    <li>Existing in <b>input file</b></li>
    <li>Loaded from <b>input digital</b> file</li>
</ul>
If <b>input digital</b> file is supplied, it will replace the digital sample if it existed in the <b>input file</b>.
<p>
    The <b>input digital</b> file can be of any type. If it's not an unsigned 8 bit uncompressed .wav file, it will be
    converted to such format. The frequency will be 22000Hz if it was so, or higher, and 11000Hz otherwise.

<p>Note: in ScummVM it played fine, but if using 22KHz in older games is a problem in original Sierra interpreter, just
    report to me, and I will change it.</p>
<p></p>
The digital sample can be played (or saved), regardless of the music from the input file. Similar rules apply to save
name and overwriting.

<h3>Misc</h3>
In GUI mode, by default, file's <b>info</b>rmation is printed. In CLI it's off by default.

<h3>Command Line Interface</h3>
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI) for Sounder have same capabilities. But sometimes
using the one is more convenient than using the other.
<p></p>
The Windows release contains two executables: <i>sounder.exe</i> and <i>sounder_no_console.exe</i>. They are almost
identical, except that the <i>sounder_no_console.exe</i> is optimized for GUI, and doesn't send anything to the console,
even if started from one. On the other hand, GUI can be started from <i>sounder.exe</i>, but it will also open the ugly
command prompt window.
<p></p>
To summarize, it's recommended to use <i>sounder_no_console.exe</i> for GUI (and it's used by the <i>Sounder</i>
shortcut), and <i>sounder.exe</i> for CLI.
<p></p>
All this discussion isn't relevant if you're using Linux, or running <i>sounder.py</i> directly.
<p></p>
If <i>sounder.py</i>/<i>sounder.exe</i>/<i>sounder_no_console.exe</i> is started without any parameters, the GUI
will be started. If it's called with any parameter, CLI will be started. To learn how to use CLI, just call it with
<code>--help</code>. The <i>sounder command line</i> shortcut refers to <i>sounder.bat</i> which does exactly that.
